## Summary of the fourth chapter of the book "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen - Training Data

The wide availability of data and the learning capabilities of Machine Learning (ML) models are crucial factors for the success of an ML system. Chapter four of "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen addresses the importance of training data, discussing how the quality and representativeness of these data directly influence the model's effectiveness. Thus, the text highlights the need for techniques that can enable models to learn significant patterns and make accurate and reliable predictions. Following are 10 key points discussed in the chapter.

1. **Importance of Sampling**: Effectively sampling data is crucial for the success of ML models. The proper choice of sampling methods directly influences the quality, efficiency, and representativeness of datasets, significantly impacting the performance and generalization of the developed models. Sampling enables efficient management of large volumes of data and reduces computational costs, besides significantly accelerating the training process. It is essential to avoid undesired biases and select the most suitable training method. In this context, sampling strategies must be carefully chosen to ensure that ML models are both efficient and fair, reflecting the diversity and complexity of the real world.

2. **Non-Probabilistic Versus Random Sampling**: There are two families of sampling, non-probabilistic and random, which will be addressed in the following:
   - **Non-Probabilistic Sampling**: This type of sampling is adopted when the probability of selecting each element in the dataset is unknown. Common methods include:
     - Convenience sampling, which selects easily accessible data but can introduce bias;
     - Snowball sampling, based on references and connections between elements;
     - Judgment sampling, which depends on the decisions of experts;
     - Quota sampling, aiming to represent different population groups.
   
     These methods tend to be more subjective and may fail to adequately represent the diversity of data, resulting in models that may not be generalizable or fair.

   - **Random Sampling**: Promotes a more objective approach, with each element having a known probability of selection. It includes:
     - Simple random sampling, offering all elements an equal chance of being chosen;
     - Stratified sampling, dividing the population into groups and selecting samples from each group proportionally;
     - Weighted sampling, where the weights of the elements are adjusted according to the model's needs, prioritizing certain subpopulations;
     - Reservoir sampling, ideal for data streams and populations of undetermined size;
     - Importance sampling, adjusting the training distribution to match the test distribution or other relevant distributions.

     Random sampling improves the objectivity and reliability of data selection, contributing to the creation of more representative and less biased models.

3. **Hand Labeling**: Manual labeling is the most costly and time-consuming method for data labeling, especially challenging in contexts of large volumes of data and when constant model updates are required. Discrepancies in labels can emerge when people of different expertise levels participate in the process, negatively affecting the model's quality. This variability highlights the complexity of manual labeling and the importance of alternative strategies to ensure consistency and quality of labeled data.

4. **Data Lineage**: Data lineage is essential for tracking the origin and transformation of data, enabling an understanding of model performance. Keeping a record of all data and model versions, as well as the labels, is crucial to ensuring the system's transparency and reliability, as more than one expert may label the data, and thus, discrepancies in labels may occur. Therefore, data lineage is critical for tracking and understanding model performance.

5. **Natural Labeling**: Utilizes labels generated automatically from user interactions, such as clicks on recommendations, to evaluate Machine Learning model performance. It offers the benefit of reducing the need for manual labeling, allowing quick model adjustments based on real feedback. However, it requires attention to label accuracy and can face challenges with long feedback cycles. Natural labeling is effective for tasks where user interaction provides a clear indication of the model's prediction success or failure but demands careful implementation to ensure the reliability of the collected data.

6. **Feedback Loop**: Represents the interval between making a model prediction and receiving the corresponding feedback, which can range from short, as in games, to long, as in medical diagnoses. A short feedback loop allows for quick label capture, facilitating the identification and correction of model problems with agility. However, this brevity can also lead to premature labeling of a recommendation as inadequate before it has been explored by the user. In contrast, longer feedback loops offer greater confidence in the accuracy of recommendations but can delay the detection of model flaws. Labels derived from extensive feedback loops are valuable for analyzing model performance in periodic business reports. However, if detecting issues is imperative and urgent, these labels may not be as effective. For example, delays in identifying flaws in a fraud detection model may eventually allow enough fraudulent transactions to compromise a company's financial viability.

7. **Handling the Lack of Labels**: The absence of labels is a common challenge in ML, especially in contexts of unstructured data such as images and texts. There are various strategies to overcome this limitation, as described in the following:
    - **Weak Supervision**: A popular approach that uses heuristic-based labeling functions to label data. Examples include:
      - **Keyword heuristic**: labels a tweet as positive if it contains words like "good" or "great";
      - **Regular expressions**: identifies specific text patterns for labeling;
      - **Database lookup**: checks if an annotation contains items listed in a specific database, such as dangerous diseases;
      - **The outputs of other models**: uses predictions from other models as labels. Including manual labeling can be beneficial for validating and refining the labeling functions, assisting in pattern discovery. Despite being a powerful method, weak supervision can generate noisy labels, but it remains a valuable starting point for exploring the feasibility of ML without significant initial investment in manual labeling.
   - **Semi-Supervision**: The model is trained with a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data. The idea is for the model to learn from the labeled data and generalize to the unlabeled ones. Semi-supervision is useful when manual labeling is expensive and time-consuming, but automatic labeling is too noisy. However, semi-supervision is not perfect. If the unlabeled data are not representative of the labeled data, the model may not generalize well. Additionally, semi-supervision can be more challenging to implement than weak supervision, as it requires an active learning model to select the most informative unlabeled data for labeling;
   - **Transfer Learning**: Used when the dataset is small. In this case, the model is trained on a large dataset and then adjusted for a smaller dataset. The idea is for the model to learn general patterns in the large dataset and then adjust those patterns for the smaller dataset;
   - **Active Learning**: The idea is for the model to select the most informative examples for labeling, allowing ML models to achieve higher accuracy with fewer training labels if they can choose which data samples to learn from. Thus, it can be very useful in data streams, allowing it to adapt more quickly to changes.

8. **Class Imbalance**: A frequent challenge in Machine Learning, where one class is significantly more prevalent than another. This imbalance can complicate model learning, as it hinders the identification of minority classes, potentially leading to a suboptimal solution and increasing costs since the error in predicting a rare class sample can be more impactful than in a majority class. This situation is common in scenarios such as fraud detection, where the incidence of fraud is much lower than legitimate transactions. Another less frequent source of imbalance can be labeling errors. Although some argue that the imbalance reflects reality and should not be corrected, addressing this issue is essential for model efficacy. Three main strategies are discussed:
   - **Using the right evaluation metrics**: Choosing metrics that accurately reflect the model's performance in class imbalance contexts is crucial, preventing misinterpretations of its effectiveness;
   - **Data-level methods: Resampling**: Adjusting the training data distribution, either by oversampling minority classes or undersampling majority classes, to balance the dataset and improve learning;
   - **Algorithm-level methods**: Modifying the learning algorithm to compensate for the imbalance, for example, by assigning differentiated weights to classes, so the model pays more attention to minority classes.

    These approaches aim to mitigate the adverse effects of class imbalance, enabling the model to learn more efficiently and fairly, regardless of the classes' frequency in the training data.

9. **Data Augmentation**: A technique aimed at expanding the training dataset by creating new examples from existing ones, with the goal of improving the model's generalization capability. Increasing data volume can help the model learn a broader variety of patterns and thereby enhance its performance on new and unseen data. Three main approaches are highlighted:
   - **Simple Label-Preserving Transformations**: Mild modifications are applied to data without changing their labels, maintaining the integrity of the information each example carries. In NLP (Natural Language Processing), this might include replacing words with their synonyms, preserving the original meaning of the text;
   - **Perturbation**: Introducing noise into data to create variations. For example, in image processing, adding visual noise to an image can help the model become more robust to subtle variations in the input data;
   - **Data Synthesis**: Generating new examples from existing data. This technique allows for more significant variations, expanding the diversity of the training set without the need to collect new external data.

    Each of these strategies contributes to building more resilient ML models capable of generalizing from a richer and more diverse training set, improving the accuracy and reliability of predictions in real-world situations.

10. **Dealing with Data Bias**: Bias in training data can lead to prejudices and discrimination in ML models, resulting in unfair and harmful decisions. To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to identify and correct biases present in the data, ensuring the model is fair and equitable. Thus, in every strategy of sampling, labeling, and data augmentation, it is essential to consider the potential introduction of biases and adopt measures to minimize them. Additionally, the diversity and representativeness of the data are crucial for building models capable of catering to a variety of contexts and scenarios.

Thus, the fourth chapter of "Designing Machine Learning Systems" addresses the critical role of training data in the success of ML models, emphasizing the importance of quality, representativeness, and fairness in data selection and labeling. By discussing various techniques and strategies to enhance the learning process, the chapter provides valuable insights into the challenges and considerations involved in training ML models effectively and responsibly. The comprehensive exploration of sampling methods, labeling techniques, and data augmentation approaches underscores the significance of robust data practices in developing reliable and accurate ML systems.
