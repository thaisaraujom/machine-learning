## Summary of three first chapters of the book "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen

In the current context of technological evolution, Machine Learning (ML) systems have become indispensable across various sectors. Despite the frequent acknowledgment of their success and efficacy, the challenges and considerations involved in their design often remain unaddressed. Thus, "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen fills this gap, particularly in its first three chapters, by questioning the perception of ML systems as complete and infallible solutions and underscoring the necessity for an iterative and adaptable approach in their development.

The first chapter provides an overview of the challenges and considerations necessary for advancing an ML model from concept to production. Huyen addresses the common misconception that ML can solve all problems, arguing that while ML is exceptionally powerful at identifying complex patterns beyond the reach of conventional human processing, it requires careful consideration of when itâ€™s appropriate to use.

The author then discusses foundational principles of what ML solutions generally accomplish. It is initially stated that the capability to learn distinguishes ML systems from static tools, such as relational databases, which cannot infer relationships without explicit instructions. In contrast, ML assimilates and applies knowledge from data for both simple and complex tasks. Another point emphasized is the issue of complex patterns, highlighting the need for non-trivial learning opportunities in the data, exemplified by the impact of Elon Musk's tweets on cryptocurrency prices or the complexities involved in determining rental prices. Moreover, the critical role of existing data is underscored, as without data, there is no learning. Regarding predictions, ML models are designed to make forecasts, thus addressing problems that necessitate such outputs. Lastly, the importance of unseen data is discussed, reflecting the requirement for learned patterns to generalize beyond the training dataset.

The second chapter explores the importance of aligning the objectives of ML systems with the broader business goals of an organization. Huyen examines how to translate business goals into quantifiable objectives for ML systems, emphasizing the need to establish clear requirements for these systems. Additionally, she introduces four fundamental pillars in the design of ML systems: reliability, scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. Reliability concerns the system's ability to function correctly despite failures; scalability pertains to its capacity to manage growth; maintainability emphasizes the ease with which a system can be understood, modified, and maintained; and adaptability focuses on the system's ability to respond to changes in data or business needs without significant disruption, especially critical in the rapidly evolving field of ML.

Furthermore, the second chapter discusses classification, regression, binary and multiclass classification, and strategies for handling high cardinality and hierarchical classification. Binary classification deals with problems involving two distinct categories, while multiclass classification addresses multiple categories, requiring sophisticated methods to ensure accuracy. High cardinality, observed in classifications with many categories, challenges model training due to the substantial data volumes needed for each class. Hierarchical classification is presented as a strategy to organize categories in a tree structure, simplifying classification and enhancing model efficiency.

The third chapter addresses the fundamentals of Data Engineering, essential for the development of efficient Machine Learning systems. Huyen emphasizes the significance of data as the foundation of any ML system, discussing challenges related to data management from collection to processing. This chapter examines various types of data, formats, and models, alongside strategies for effectively storing and processing large data volumes. It also considers the diversity of data sources, including both direct user inputs and data automatically generated by systems.

Additionally, this chapter compares data formats, such as JSON for its versatility, with formats such as Parquet, known for their efficiency in analytics due to columnar storage and optimized compression. The selection among different formats, organized by row or column, textual or binary, highlights the importance of choosing suitable technology based on the specific needs of each system. Data models are explored, from relational models organizing data into interconnected tables to NoSQL models based on documents and graphs. While these models offer flexibility for some applications, they may pose challenges in extracting information due to the lack of a standardized format. Strategies for data storage and processing are discussed, distinguishing between transactional and analytical processes and introducing the ETL process as critical in preparing data for ML applications. Finally, the chapter contrasts batch processing with stream processing, emphasizing the necessity for ML systems to integrate both approaches to effectively manage dynamic and static data.

In summary, "Designing Machine Learning Systems" emerges as an invaluable resource for those in the field of Machine Learning, offering a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the iterative design and implementation process for these systems. The first three chapters not only delineate the challenges encountered in constructing such systems but also provide clear guidance for overcoming them, focusing on data quality, alignment with business objectives, and the adoption of robust engineering practices.
