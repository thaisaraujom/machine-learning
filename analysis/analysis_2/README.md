## Analysis of the chapter zero of the book "The Principles of Deep Learning Theory" by Daniel A. Roberts and Sho Yaida

In the global context, with the advent of Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning, has emerged as a technology capable of performing complex tasks previously seen only as human assignments. In this scenario, the initial chapter of the book "The Principles of Deep Learning Theory" addresses fundamental theories and concepts that underpin Deep Learning, highlighting the importance of research methods and the understanding of the theory of aspects related to deep neural networks.

Firstly, the book highlights the effectiveness of physical theories, with thermodynamics as a precursor, and the detailed theoretical predictions stemming from statistical mechanics that led to the acceptance of the standard model of particle physics. This, in turn, led to quantum mechanics, the precursor of the transistor, and subsequently to the current Information Age. Moreover, the authors emphasize the importance of the method beyond mere discovery, as when applied correctly, it can lead to even more significant findings.

Furthermore, the book discusses neural networks as computational systems composed of basic units called neurons, which process information in parallel to compute a function, or in other words, perform a task. Each neuron executes a simple function, based on a weighted sum of inputs and activates upon exceeding a specific threshold. When combined, these neurons form deep neural networks, featuring multiple layers, which allow for the performance of complex tasks. These networks are parameterized by thresholds and weighted connections, known as weights, and can contain billions of parameters.

Consequently, a neural network is simplified by the concept of parameter tuning within a parameterized function $f(x; \theta)$, where $x$ is the input and $\theta$ is the set of parameters. Thus, the learning process is divided into two stages: the first involves the initialization of the parameters $\theta$ from a simple probability distribution, followed by the adjustment of these parameters. The goal is then for the output $f(x; \theta^*)$ to approximate as closely as possible a desired target function $f(x)$. This function is referred to as the approximation function, and the values of the parameter set $\theta^*$ are determined through the training of the network.

In addition, when addressing the technical challenges of neural networks, the authors utilize the Taylor expansion of the network function after training, $f(x; \theta^*)$. Initially, the expansion highlights the complexity involved in approximating the trained function, as the distance between the trained and initial parameters widens, necessitating the consideration of an increasing number of terms. This increase in complexity complicates the understanding of the behavior of the trained neural network. The second problem arises from the random sampling of $\theta$ from the initialization distribution, resulting in different network functions with each initialization. This makes each term of the Taylor expansion a random function of the input data $x$, inducing a distribution over the network function and its derivatives that has a complex statistical dependence, challenging the attainment of a precise analytical representation. Additionally, the authors emphasize the complexity of the training process, marked by the non-uniqueness of the learned parameter values, $\theta^*$, which are influenced by various factors, including the learning algorithm and the training data. This multifactorial dependence makes the fine-tuning of parameters a complex process.

Another point mentioned by the authors is the concept of sparsity. They discuss how increasing the number of neurons per layer, while keeping the number of layers constant, simplifies the analysis of neural networks. This process, known as the infinite width limit, makes complex analytical issues more accessible by eliminating some mathematical complications, allowing the functions of the network to operate more independently and linearizing the learning dynamics. This facilitates the attainment of analytical solutions for the network parameters, $\theta^*$, resulting in a trained distribution that is simpler to understand, resembling a Gaussian distribution.

However, this method of extending the width of deep neural networks to infinity, while theoretically simplifying the analysis, presents discrepancies when compared to practical applications, especially for networks with more than one layer. This simplification prevents the network from learning effectively because the transformations that should occur in the hidden layers during training do not happen, limiting the type of function the network can learn. To address this, the authors suggest a new approach that adjusts the model, using a method inspired by physics. This method adjusts the model to consider the width of the network in a way that allows for the incorporation of interactions between neurons that the original model overlooked. With this correction, the analysis becomes more representative of what actually happens in neural networks, particularly in how they are trained and the functions they are capable of learning.

Finally, it is highlighted that a truncated description approach, based on the order of $\frac{1}{n}$, allows for analytical analyses of deep neural networks, which more accurately reflects the behavior of real networks, taking into account the interaction between neurons and the influence of the learning algorithm. Moreover, adjustments in the $\frac{1}{n}$ expansion emphasize the importance of the relationship between the depth and width of the network, crucial for distinguishing between truly deep networks and those that are not. Consequently, networks that maintain a balanced ratio of depth to width prove to be more functional, underscoring the practical utility of this truncated method.

In this way, the initial chapter of the book "The Principles of Deep Learning Theory" highlights the importance of theory in understanding Deep Learning, addressing fundamental concepts and technical challenges inherent to deep neural networks. The approach the book takes, involving expanding the analysis to infinite width limits and applying corrections through perturbation theory, provides a foundation for understanding and analytically addressing complex problems. However, this approach also presents limitations, such as the discrepancy between simplified theoretical models and the actual behavior of neural networks, especially those with multilayer architectures and nonlinear behavior. Additionally, the chapter presents the challenge of maintaining analytical precision without losing sight of the real complexity and dynamics of neural networks. Thus, the chapter provides fundamental concepts for an initial understanding of Deep Learning theory.
